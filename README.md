# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A fun and interactive **memory-based web game** where players repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds shown by the computer. Each correct sequence takes you to the next level — one mistake, and it’s game over!

---

## 🧩 How to Play

1. Press any key (or the Start button) to begin the game.  
2. Watch the color sequence carefully — each color will flash and after each correct sequence,it will play a success sound.  
3. Repeat the exact sequence by clicking on the color buttons.  
4. Each round adds a new color to the pattern, increasing difficulty.  
5. The game ends when you press a wrong color. You can restart anytime.
